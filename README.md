# Forecast

An iOS app written in **Swift**, built in **VIPER** based architecture. The app displays the latest forecast in Celcius or Fahrenheit of main cities around the world in a **UITableView** populated by a **Custom UITableViewCell**. By selecting a city, you can see a 5-day forecast of the selected city. All forecasts are displayed by numbers, description and an image for easy understanding. All server requests in the app are **Rest API URL Session requests** and data is parsed into **Codable implemented Structs**.
